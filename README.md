Hello There!
=========
- I'm Kemo, a 18 year old programmer who converts any caffeine drink to code or a readable IDA pro pseudo code, primarily uses C++ and haxe. along with Javascript and a little bit of C#, i break software and mainly games to mod and make them cooler and more enjoyable. I used to mod fortnite back in the day but i currently do commissions for FNF coding. if you are interested in more about my skills, projects or commissions you can check my [portfolio](https://kemo.dev/).


- Currently I'm studying at the Faculty of Commerce, i live in Egypt (where internet is limited and expensive) hence i am looking for a job to secure some money, as i commissions doesn't cover much.

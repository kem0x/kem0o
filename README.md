Hello There!
=========
- I'm Kemo, a 20 year old programmer who converts any caffeine drink to code or a readable IDA pro pseudo code, primarily uses C++. but i also have past experience with haxe - c# - javascript and rust, i mod software and mainly games to make them cooler and more enjoyable. I used to mod fortnite and friday night funkin' in the past too!. if you are interested in more about my skills and projects you can check my [portfolio](https://kem.ooo/).


- Currently I'm studying at the Faculty of Commerce, i live in Egypt (where internet is limited and expensive) hence i am looking for a job to secure some money, since open sourcing everything doesn't really help me financially ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
